<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

We have some links to external websites within our Service, on our app description page, and even in this Privacy Policy. Clicking on the link will direct you to the website, though I assume you've used the internet before and already know this (hint for general web safety: hover over the link and view it, or copy the link text and paste it into a text/note app to verify it is linking you to where you intend to go). You should independently view and abide by the privacy policies found on those sites, but we do not control, endorse, nor take any responsibility for the content found on those sites.
